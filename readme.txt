Python scripts to process, visualize, and model accelerometer and gyroscope data to create a machine learning model that can classify barbell exercises and count repetitions.
Data was collected using MetaMotion Sensor from MBIENTLAB

The model can detect what kind of barbell exercise you perform with around 99.5% accuracy. Almost all errors are when classifying row exercises, since the data from accelerometer on your wrist looks very similar to the one from the deadlifts. 
When it comes to counting repetitions, the best accuracy score that i got was 89%, not as impressive as exercise classification but still very good outcome.
